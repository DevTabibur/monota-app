Either go for the cheaper ASUS ruggadized models, or go more expensive for models with touchscreen and a real processor, but don't get this one. Way too slow. You can't watch any type of TV streaming on it, it's so laggy it hurts.",

Crostini works great on this unit, so getting access to Linux apps (based on the Debian 9 armhf build) was easy, including X11-based apps. This unit does not support Android apps, but then comparatively few do, so no points lost there. The SoC is a touch on the slow side, but not too bad!",

No matter what angle you choose, it looks washed out. Some colors are so undersaturated that it's hard to see gradients.",

We had been looking for an affordable Chromebook of good quality for watching videos, browsing the internet and using google documents. The battery life is awesome and the resolution is great. He's been using it since December and is very happy with it.",
